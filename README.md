# highlighter

View a folder of images (presumably book pages) with the ability to highlight rectangular regions (presumably lines or paragraphs).

Left and right arrow keys move you up or down the folder. It's a simple tool for a fast workflow, if that workflow requires marking regions of books that you have read.

Highlights are non-destructive (they are stored in a text file), they do not overwrite the images.
